    <h1>Physicist Network Project</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our physicist network project! We used web scraping techniques to collect data from Wikipedia and analyzed the connections between physicists to understand how the field of physics has evolved over time. Through our research, we uncovered some fascinating insights about the relationships between physicists and how they have influenced each other's work. Explore our interactive visualizations to learn more about our findings.</p>
